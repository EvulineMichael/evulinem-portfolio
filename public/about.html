      <h1>Featured Projects</h1>
      <p>Here's a look at one of my recent projects that I'm particularly proud of:</p>
    
      <div class="project-highlight">
        <h3>Vania Naturelle Beauty & Wellness Shop</h3>
        <p>
          This project was special to me as it was my first full website design and development project. I had the opportunity to create a comprehensive online platform for a distributor of health and beauty products. 
          The website provides detailed information on each product and includes an intuitive order form for customers to place orders directly online. 
          The aim was to craft a user-friendly, informative site that not only streamlined the ordering process but also enhanced the overall user experience.
        </p>
      </div>
    
      <!-- 2. Provide Context and Value -->
      <p>
        This project was significant because it allowed me to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve real-world challenges in the health and beauty industry. 
        The goal was to develop an online presence that effectively showcased the client's extensive range of products while offering a seamless shopping experience. 
        The result was a responsive, attractive website that greatly improved the client's online engagement and sales.

      <p>Here's a look at a project that holds a special place in my heart:</p>
    
      <div class="project-highlight">
        <h3>BP Analyzer</h3>
        <p>
          The BP Analyzer is a website I developed to assist individuals, particularly my parents, in monitoring and understanding their blood pressure readings. 
          The website provides detailed guidelines on how to properly check blood pressure, a logging feature to record systolic and diastolic values, 
          a trend analysis tool to visualize blood pressure trends over time, and articles focused on managing health as one ages.
        </p>
      </div>
    
      <!-- 2. Provide Context and Value -->
      <p>
        This project was born out of a personal need to help my parents manage their health more effectively. 
        The BP Analyzer simplifies the process of checking blood pressure and interpreting the results, 
        especially for those who might struggle with the technical aspects. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of backend integration, 
        I created a user-friendly platform that empowers users to take control of their health.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, I'm pretty proud of this one‚Äîif there were a 'Best Child of the Year' award, I‚Äôd totally be in the running!
      </p>
    
      <!-- 3. Include a Testimonial (if available) -->
      <blockquote>
        "The BP Analyzer has been a game-changer for us. It makes tracking our blood pressure easy and helps us understand what the numbers mean." 
        ‚Äî My Parents.
